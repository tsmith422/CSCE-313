## Labs

### Lab 1: Environment Setup, Debugging, and C++ Refresh
In this lab, we set up the development environment, learned debugging techniques, and refreshed our knowledge of C++.

### Lab 2: Introduction to Unnamed Pipes
In this lab, we created a pipe and forked to create children in order to run two commands using C++.

### Lab 3: User-Space Thread Library
In this lab, we implemented a user-space, cooperative, multi-tasking library.

## Programming Assignments

### PA 1: Named Pipes
In this programming assignment, we wrote a client program that connects to a server using named pipes and uses the exported API of the server.
The client communicates with the server to complete two tasks:
1. Obtain individual data points from the server.
2. Obtain a whole raw file of any size in one or more segments
from the server.
